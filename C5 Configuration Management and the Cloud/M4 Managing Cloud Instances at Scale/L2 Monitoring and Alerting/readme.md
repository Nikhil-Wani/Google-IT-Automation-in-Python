## Notes

* **Monitoring** let us look into the history and current status of a system
* You only want to store the metrics that you care about, since storing all these metrics in the system takes space, and storage space costs money
* **Whitebox monitoring** checks the behavior of the system from the inside
* Raising an alert signal that somethind is broken and a human needs to respond
* **Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)**: Pre-established performance goals for a specific service
* **Service-Level Agreement (SLA)**: A commitment between a provider and a client
