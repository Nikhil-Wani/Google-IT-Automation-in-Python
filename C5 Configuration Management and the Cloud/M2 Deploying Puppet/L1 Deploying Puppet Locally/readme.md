## Notes

* **Catalog** is the list of rules that are generated for one specific computer once the server has evaluated all variables, conditionals, and functions
* We write resource type in lowercase when declaring them, but capitalize them when referring to them from another resource's attribute
* **Module** is a collection of manifests and associated data
