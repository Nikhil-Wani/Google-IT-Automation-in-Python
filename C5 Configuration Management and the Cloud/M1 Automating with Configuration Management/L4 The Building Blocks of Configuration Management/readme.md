## Notes

* **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** is a programming language that's more limited in scope
* **Facts** are variables that represent the characteristics of the system
* An **idempotent** action can be performed over and over again without changing the system after the first time the action was performed, and with no unintended side effects.
