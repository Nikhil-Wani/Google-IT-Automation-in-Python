## Notes

* **Load balancer** ensure that each node receives a balanced number of requests
* **Autoscaling** allows the service to increase or reduce capacity as needed, while the service owner only pays for the cost of the machines that are in use at any given time
* **Orchestration** is the atomated configuration and coordination of complex IT system and services
* **Hybrid cloud**: Only part of the services are in the cloud
