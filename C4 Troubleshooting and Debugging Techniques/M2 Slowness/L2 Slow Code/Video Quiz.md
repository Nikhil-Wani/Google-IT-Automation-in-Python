## Video: Using the Right Data Structures

Which of the following has values associated with keys in Python?

## Video: Expensive Loops

Your Python script searches a directory, and runs other tasks in a single loop function for 100s of computers on the network. Which action will make the script the least expensive?

* **Read the directory once**
* Loop the total number of computers
* Service only half of the computers
* Use more memory 

> Reading the directory once before the loop will make the script less expensive to run.

## Video: Keeping Local Results

Your script calculates the average number of active user sessions during business hours in a seven-day period. How often should a local cache be created to give a good enough average without updating too often?

* Once a week
* **Once a day**
* Once a month
* Once every 8 hours 

> A local cache for every day can be accessed quickly, and processed for a seven-day average calculation.

## Video: Slow Script with Expensive Loop

You use the time command to determine how long a script runs to complete its various tasks. Which output value will show the time spent doing operations in the user space?

* Real
* Wall-clock
* Sys
* **User**

> The user value is the time spent doing operations in the user space.
