## Video: Dealing with Complex Slow Systems

A company has a single web server hosting a website that also interacts with an external database server. The web server is processing requests very slowly. Checking the web server, you found the disk I/O has high latency. Where is the cause of the slow website requests most likely originating from?

* **Local disk**
* Remote database
* Slow Internet
* Database index 

> The local disk I/O latency is causing the application to wait too long for data from disk.
